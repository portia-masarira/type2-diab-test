RUNNING THE PROJECT

- To start a virtual environment in Python, you can use a tool called virtualenv or the built-in venv module (introduced in Python 3.3). Here's how to do it using venv:

Open your terminal or command prompt:

Navigate to your project directory:

[ cd path/to/your/project ]


Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

[ myenv\Scripts\activate ]

On macOS and Linux:

[ source myenv/bin/activate ]

When the virtual environment is activated, you'll see its name in your terminal prompt.

Install dependencies:
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install Python packages using pip, and they will be isolated from the system-wide Python installation:

[ pip install -r requirements.txt ]


Run the development server:
Start the Django development server by running the following command:


[ python manage.py runserver ]

This will start the development server, and by default, it will listen on http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Access your Django project:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/. You should see your Django project running.


Deactivate the virtual environment:
When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it:


[ deactivate ]

PRE-POPULATING THE DATABASE
use the following command, it will ask the number of entities to be created:

[ python3 manage.py populate_db ]
for PatientData table

[ python3 manage.py populate_db2 ]
for EarlyDiagnosisPatient table
